# Required Tasks
## VirtualPet class
- [ ] You will need to create a VirtualPet class.
- [ ] Create at least three instance variables (aka attributes aka properties aka fields).
- [ ] Create at least three methods (messages you send to your pet).
- [ ] Create a tick() method that represents the passage of time.
## VirtualPetApp class
- [ ] Create a main method.
- [ ] implements a game loop.
- [ ] asks for user input.
- [ ] writes output to the console.


## Stretch Tasks
- [ ] Give the pet the ability to take care of some of its own needs.

Pets are not robots - they usually have some sort of self-determination! When tick() is called, you might want to have your pet take a look at its needs and address one, prioritizing whichever need is highest. You could also make your pet uncooperative - when the user tries to feed the pet, for example, you might make the pet refuse to eat if it is bored. Remember how we created an instance of the Random class to create a random number generator? You might want to incorporate that.

- [ ] Create a visual representation of your pet.

Rather than using numbers to convey your petâ€™s status, you could have some sort of visual representation of the pet. I.e., instead of printing hunger: 50, you could use smileys or ASCII art to show hunger when hunger >= 50.

Allow users to take dogs on walks.
Walking organic pets decreases the rate at which they soil their cages/litter boxes.
Walking robotic pets increases their need for oil and maintenance.
